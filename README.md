Contains PyTorch implementation of the AdVIL, AdRIL, and DAeQuIL algorithms.

## Setup
To install dependencies, run:
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

## Running Experiments
To train an expert, run:
```bash
python experts/train.py -e env_name
```

To train a learner, run:
```bash
python learners/train.py -a algo_name -e env_name -n num_runs
```
This package supports training via:
- Behavioral Cloning
- AdVIL
- SQIL
- GAIL
- AdRIL

We also support a comparison of the following algorithms that require an interactive expert on both OpenAI Gym and a custom environment:
- DAgger
- DAeQuIL

To explore these algorithms and environments, run:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
and open up learners/imm.ipynb.

## Visualizing Results
Run:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
and open up vis.ipynb.
